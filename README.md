# Electric Mix

## An iOS app made during SwiftUIJam Nov 2021

Inspired by COP26 this app uses data from the National Grid ESO Data portal to display the change in generation sources over the last decade.

A dataset was processed to give the monthly average figures and included in the app bundle as a JSON file. It is displayed as a pie chart. I used WWDC 2019 session 237 as a starting point to try presenting and animating data using SwiftUI.

My intention was to have an animated timeline but due to time limits I didn't quite get there. This is the first time I've taken part in a coding jam. The code is messy and unfinished, but it was good fun and an interesting challenge.
